### A statement about Free Software
################################################################################

I believe in free software. For me, this also means that I do not believe in
copyrights, trademarks, patents, nor any other government enforced monopoly
privilege. 

You probably downloaded this software from my website. By doing so, you did not
first enter into any sort of agreement or contract with me. There were no rules
established before you downloaded it -- I simply offered the file on my website
and you simply downloaded it. I am not your master -- it is immoral for me to 
use any (initiated) force against you, including the force of government.

However, I am a human being. I enjoy praise, attribution, and other rewards for
my work. If you find this software useful, I appreciate comments to that effect.
If you find this software _very_ useful, I appreciate gifts. If you make useful
modifications to this software, I appreciate patches. If you incorporate this
software into a product of your own, I like to know about it, and I like being
mentioned in your product's documentation or website. But again, I am not your
master -- It is wrong for me to force you to do anything. I can only ask.

I have chosen to release this software under the MIT license for the convenience
of contributers and users who are accustomed to working with software released
under traditional open source licenses, but I pledge that I will not pursue any
legal recourse for violations of the MIT license.
